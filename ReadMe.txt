Abstract:
	We present the results of the observations of the Uranian satellites made with the 26-inch
	refractor at the Pulkovo Observatory in 2007 -- 2016. 

Description:
	Presented observations of the main Uranian satellites were made with the 26-inch refractor (D/F = 65 cm / 1041.3 cm)
	at the Pulkovo Observatory in 2007 - 2016. The CCD camera FLI Pro Line was used (3056x3056 px, each pixel of 12 microns).
	The field of view -- 12'x12', focal plane scale --  19".8/mm, scale on the CCD frames -- 0",24/px. TAlmost 7000 CCD frames were analyzed and reduced
	using the UCAC4 catalog. Observation processing and coordinate measurement were performed with the IZMCCD software package (izmccd.puldb.ru).
	Special approach was used to eliminate a scaterred halo caused by the bright planet.
